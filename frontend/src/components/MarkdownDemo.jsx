    explanation: `## ðŸš© Problem â€” Hot Air Balloon & an Observer 

A hot-air balloon rises vertically from a point on level ground. An observer stands 500 m away from the balloon's launch point. The observer measures the angle of elevation Î¸ to the balloon. At a certain instant the angle is Î¸=Ï€/6 and is increasing at a rate of dÎ¸/dt=0.01 rad/s. 

**Find:**
- How fast is the balloon rising at that instant? (Find dh/dt, where h is the balloon's height)
- How fast is the straight-line distance r from the observer to the balloon changing at that instant? (Find dr/dt)

---

Okay, let's break down this hot air balloon problem step-by-step. This is a classic **"related rates"** problem, meaning we're given information about the rates of change of some quantities and asked to find the rate of change of another related quantity.

## 1. Understanding Related Rates and Why Prerequisites Matter

Related rates problems rely heavily on the **Chain Rule** (which you've covered) and your knowledge of **Trigonometric Derivatives**. The Chain Rule is crucial because it allows us to connect the rates of change of different variables that are related through a function. Trig derivatives are needed because the angle of elevation relates the height and distance via trigonometric functions.

## 2. Setting up the Problem

- **Visualize:** Draw a right triangle. The horizontal distance from the observer to the launch point is constant (500 m). The height of the balloon (h) is the vertical side, and the straight-line distance from the observer to the balloon (r) is the hypotenuse. The angle of elevation is Î¸.

- **Identify Given Information:**
  - \`dÎ¸/dt = 0.01 rad/s\` (rate of change of the angle)
  - \`Î¸ = Ï€/6\` (the angle at the specific instant)
  - Horizontal distance = 500 m (constant)

- **Identify What We Need to Find:**
  - \`dh/dt\` (rate of change of the balloon's height)
  - \`dr/dt\` (rate of change of the straight-line distance)

## 3. Finding dh/dt (How fast the balloon is rising)

- **Relate h and Î¸:** Use the tangent function: \`tan(Î¸) = h/500\`. This connects the height *h* to the angle *Î¸*, which is essential. Therefore, \`h = 500 * tan(Î¸)\`.

- **Differentiate with respect to time (t):** This is where the Chain Rule comes in. We differentiate both sides of the equation \`h = 500 * tan(Î¸)\` with respect to *t*:

  $$\\frac{dh}{dt} = 500 \\cdot \\sec^2(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$$

  - We use the Chain Rule because \`Î¸\` is a function of time (\`Î¸(t)\`), and we're differentiating \`tan(Î¸(t))\` with respect to *t*.
  - The derivative of \`tan(Î¸)\` is \`secÂ²(Î¸)\`. This is a standard **Trigonometric Derivative** you need to know.

- **Substitute and Solve:** Now, plug in the given values: \`Î¸ = Ï€/6\` and \`dÎ¸/dt = 0.01 rad/s\`. Recall that \`sec(Ï€/6) = 2/âˆš3\`.

  $$\\frac{dh}{dt} = 500 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 \\cdot 0.01 = 500 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 0.01 = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\text{ m/s}$$

  So, the balloon is rising at approximately **6.67 meters per second**.

## 4. Finding dr/dt (How fast the straight-line distance is changing)

- **Relate r and h:** Use the Pythagorean theorem: \`rÂ² = 500Â² + hÂ²\`.

- **Differentiate with respect to time (t):** Again, use the Chain Rule:

  $$2r \\cdot \\frac{dr}{dt} = 0 + 2h \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}$$
  
  (The derivative of 500Â² is zero because it's a constant).

  Simplify: $$r \\cdot \\frac{dr}{dt} = h \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}$$

- **Solve for dr/dt:** $$\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{h}{r} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}$$

- **Find h and r at the given instant:**
  - We know \`Î¸ = Ï€/6\`, so \`h = 500 * tan(Ï€/6) = 500 / âˆš3\`.
  - \`r = âˆš(500Â² + hÂ²) = âˆš(500Â² + (500/âˆš3)Â²) = âˆš(500Â² + 500Â²/3) = âˆš(4 * 500Â² / 3) = (2 * 500) / âˆš3 = 1000/âˆš3\`

- **Substitute and Solve:**

  $$\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{500/\\sqrt{3}}{1000/\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\text{ m/s}$$

  So, the straight-line distance is increasing at approximately **3.33 meters per second**.

## 5. Summary and Learning Path Connections

- We used trigonometric functions (\`tan(Î¸)\`) to relate the variables.
- We applied the Chain Rule to differentiate with respect to time.
- We used trigonometric derivatives (\`d/dÎ¸ tan(Î¸) = secÂ²(Î¸)\`).
- We used the Pythagorean theorem, which is a fundamental geometric concept.
