Chapter: Methods of Integration

Basic Functions:
A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs. Functions are typically denoted as f(x) where x is the input variable. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values, while the range is the set of all possible output values.

Limits:
The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a value c is the value that f(x) gets arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to c. We write this as lim(x→c) f(x) = L. Limits are fundamental to calculus and form the basis for derivatives and integrals.

Derivatives:
The derivative of a function measures how the function changes as its input changes. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. The derivative of f(x) is denoted as f'(x) or df/dx.

Integration:
Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. The integral of a function f(x) gives us the area under the curve of f(x). There are two types: definite integrals (which give a numerical value) and indefinite integrals (which give a family of functions).

U-Substitution:
U-substitution is a technique for evaluating integrals by making a substitution that simplifies the integrand. We substitute u for a function of x, making the integral easier to evaluate.

Integration by Parts:
Integration by parts is used when the integrand is a product of two functions. The formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, where u and dv are chosen strategically to simplify the integral.
